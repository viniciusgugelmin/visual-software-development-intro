## About The Project
First Activity - Visual Software Development
(1st Bimester - Positivo University)

Exercise 01
 
Write an algorithm that takes the height and width of a rectangle and calculates its area.

Exercise 02

Create an algorithm that allows you to make three currency conversions. The algorithm must receive the amount in real (BRL) and present the amounts converted into:
a) Dollar (1 dollar = 5.17 reais)
b) Euro (1 euro = 6.14 reais)
c) Argentine Peso (1 Argentine Peso = 0.05 reais)

Exercise 03
 
Receive two integers and inform which value read is the smallest and which is the largest.

Exercise 04
  
Develop an algorithm to read the integer value of a person's age and print one of the messages: if age <= 13: Child, if age > 13 and <= 18: Adolescent, if age > 18 and <= 60: Adult and if age > 60: Elderly.


Exercise 05
 
Create an algorithm that takes a positive integer value and prints the Fibonacci sequence up to the read value. For example: if the user enters the number 15, the program must print the numbers 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13.

Exercise 06

Develop an algorithm to automatically receive 1000 values ​​into a vector and sort from smallest to largest.
